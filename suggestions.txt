Raspberry Pi network audio player options

Raspberry Pi can simply run a web server with various songs preloaded on the 
SD card. However this can be limiting so using a web service such as Spotify 
may be preferred. 

The following methods are useful if the audio server and/or controller cannot 
be the renderer. This is the case with using Spotify since the Pi does not 
have flash player for use with its web browser. 

Methods of streaming audio to the Pi

1. 	Pulse Audio 
	
	Pros -
	Easy to set up
	Low Latency

	Cons -
	Suffers audio distortion from packet loss
	Not designed for network use 

2. 	UPnP AV Media (DLNA) Server/Renderer
	
	Pros -
	Fairly easy to set up
	Uses DLNA standard
	High fidelity audio
	Medium Latency (~500ms)

	Cons -
	Hard to find media players that can search DLNA renderers on the network (BubbleUPnP on Android)


3.	AirPlay using Shairport
	
	Pros -
	Easy to set up and use
	Works with all Apple devices (the servers)
	High fidelity audio

	Cons -
	High Latency (~1-2 seconds)
	
4. 	Bluetooth audio device
	
	Pros -
	Very portable
	Easy to configure from a master controller
	High quality/Low latency audio

	Cons - 
	May be difficult to integrate with a web server jukebox
